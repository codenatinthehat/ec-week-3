<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Old Fashioned cocktail is a timeless classic with a history dating back to the early 19th century. It's considered one of the oldest known cocktails, and its origins can be traced to the early days of American cocktail culture. Originally known simply as a "whiskey cocktail", it consisted of a straightforward combination of whiskey, sugar, water, and bitters. As time passed, the cocktail evolved, and the name "Old Fashioned" emerged to distinguish it from newer, more elaborate concoctions.</p>
